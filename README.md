# Emojify
App that lets you access the native camera and scan your captured face to identify the most appropriate emoji for you to share with others! This uses Libraries to simplify the implementation work but still bringing up good results.

This is a exercise repository for the Emojify example app which is part of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).
